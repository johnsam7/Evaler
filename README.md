# Evaler
Python package that relies on MNE-python for quantifying resolution metrics for evaluating spatial fidelity of M/EEG source estimates.

Example code in for_manuscript.py and some subject data in subj_data for regenerating data and the figures in the article 
"Spatial Fidelity of MEG/EEG Source Estimates: A General Evaluation Approach". 

Dependencies: The MNE-python environment and plyfile.

Installation: 
1. Install and activate the MNE-python environment (should work with version 0.18 and newer)
2. pip install plyfile
3. python setup.py install
